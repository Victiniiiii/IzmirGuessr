# IzmirGuessr 

Disclaimer: You may get locations from the your selected districts' neighbor districts because i had to use rectangle zones for the districts and districts are not rectangular.

How to play this game ?

When you start up the game you will spawn in a random street in Izmir, if you have selected districts the playzone will be restricted to those districts, and you
have to guess where you are based on your surroundings. You need to mark your guess in the small map in the bottom right, and you will get points depending on
how close your guess is to the original destination. Have fun !
